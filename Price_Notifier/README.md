# üö® Price Notifier üí∞

A Python application that allows you to track product prices from different websites. You can add products, set a target price, refresh prices, and receive notifications when the current price meets your target.  

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This tool currently works with **static HTML pages**. For websites that load prices dynamically with JavaScript, you may need to use APIs or automation tools like Selenium/Playwright.
