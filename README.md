# 🧰 Python Projects Portfolio

Welcome! 👋 This repository is a collection of my Python projects — each one designed to solve a problem, automate a task, or explore a new concept.
Think of this repo as my personal toolbox 🛠️ + learning lab 🧪, where I’ve been experimenting with automation, data analysis, AI-related tools, and backend utilities.

🚀 Tech Stack
	•	Core: Python 3.8+
	•	Libraries Used:
	    - requests, beautifulsoup4
	    - matplotlib
	    - pillow
	    - statistics (stdlib)
	•	Concepts Explored: Automation, data analysis, CSV parsing, web scraping, file handling, and basic backend logic.

 Each project has its own README.md with detailed instructions, but here’s a quick overview:

⸻

### 📂 Projects Overview

1. 🗂️ Auto Backup

Automatically create timestamped ZIP backups of any folder.
🔹 Useful for keeping projects organized and safe.
📌 [See details](https://github.com/AitorPereira/Automation/tree/main/Auto_Backup)

⸻

2. 📂 Auto File Mover

Organize files by automatically moving them into timestamped folders.
🔹 Great for decluttering directories and managing data.
📌 [See details](https://github.com/AitorPereira/Automation/tree/main/Auto_File_Mover)

3. 📊 Data Analyzer

Interactive CLI app to explore CSVs: calculate stats, group values, and generate bar/line charts with matplotlib.
🔹 Your quick data-analysis assistant.
📌 [See details](https://github.com/AitorPereira/Automation/tree/main/Data_Analyzer)

4. 🖼️ Image Converter

Convert images between formats (JPG, PNG, WEBP, etc.) using Pillow.
🔹 Works on single images or full folders.
📌 [See details](https://github.com/AitorPereira/Automation/tree/main/Image_Converter)

5. 🚨 Price Notifier 💰

Track product prices from websites and get notified when they hit your target.
⚠️ Works with static HTML pages (dynamic content may need Selenium/Playwright).
📌 [See details](https://github.com/AitorPereira/Automation/tree/main/Price_Notifier)

6. 🌐 Basic Web Scraper

Scrape headlines and articles from any website and save them into CSV.
🔹 Uses requests + BeautifulSoup, lightweight and simple.
📌 [See details](https://github.com/AitorPereira/Automation/blob/main/Web_Scraper/README.md)
